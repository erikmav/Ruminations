# Browsers vs. Apps

When using your phone or an iPad or tablet with its easy-to-use app store, you're probably tempted to
install all the apps for all the things you normally use. On your desktop machine you might install
the app, or might use the browser to log into the web sites for your apps.

**I avoid apps whenever and wherever I can.**

The previous post on [safer browsing](./safer-browsing-2026.md) provides the clues why, but here's
the way to think of the apps you are installing: They're like using non-private browsing while
providing the app with all sorts of information from the sensors on your phone or tablet,
such as your precise location, watching you from the camera, listening to you from the microphone,
pretty much anything the app is allowed to do on your phone, especially if you mindlessly or accidentally
grant permissions to the camera, GPS/location, and mic.

There have been many nefarious actions by apps such as noted above. The app stores and phone
operating system vendors try to add in restrictions, and the apps get updates to try to get around the
restrictions. Sometimes it's just plain app bugs that cause the problems, instead of explicit
malfeasance. Either way, I avoid them whenever possible, and just use private or non-private
browser windows on both my phone and my desktop.

Yes it's pretty easy to let Instagram access your GPS location and personal information to tag your
cool picture. Yes it's pretty easy to let the Amazon app use notifications on your phone to let you
know about sales or recommendations or delivery updates. Yes it's great to install the app for every
airline you use in order to tap and swipe your way to the boarding pass QR codes you need for
your connecting flights.

It takes a bit more effort to explicitly browse to Amazon.com or your airline or Instagram
and use your login to do the same things. But at least you're not at the mercy of all the apps'
various bugs and malfeasance that collect even more information on you to be sold to data middlemen
(see the previous post).

And in my experience, you save a lot of battery life having fewer apps with their notification
services eating your battery power all day long.

At the very least, if you have to install an app for a new airline, try to delete the app after
your trip.
