# Do You Really Need that Desktop?

In some places of the world, laptops and desktop PCs are not even a thing, and people use their phones
for all their computing needs. Granted they may not be spending the whole day every day sitting in
front of a stack of laptops and multiple screens, but the phone interface - or at most a mid-sized
cheap Android tablet - covers their needs just fine.

While doing ad-hoc support for the PCs and phones of family and friends, it keeps occurring to me
that many people are continuing to use, say, a Windows desktop or laptop simply because of a mix of
familiarity and inertia, but the laptop or desktop is far more than they actually need in their lives,
and add excessive complexity and more susceptibility to phishing.

I've now recommended to several people, with varying degrees of success, that they can and should move
away from their full-featured desktop OS to something simpler like an iPad or Android tablet.
Especially in the move to iPad, with its newer OS design that constrains what apps can do
(see [discussion](./safer-browsing-2026.md#operating-systems) in the Safe Browsing article), they
are far less susceptible to phishing attacks where someone prompts them to install malware,
whereas such rootkit/botkit installs are absolutely devastating on the 1980s/90s older OS designs
(Windows, Mac, Linux) since apps and installers running as administrator can do so much to the system.

Of course, change is a big deal for many people, particularly older people, so this move might not work
for some. As an example, we recently had to slide in an iPad solution while a Windows laptop was down,
and the user was able to eventually get used to using email and financial apps from what was
a big phone from their point of view. When the laptop was back the iPad went in a drawer, but at
least for a short time there was a bit of learning about alternative devices.
